# odin_login_page
This is a form project from the Odin Project course website.


# Plan of Attack:

I need to create and style a form.

##### Page Layout
    - Background image on left hand side of the page
        - Should contain a logo with imported text. Background for logo should be transparent.
    - Form on the right hand side of the page.
        - Text on top.
        - 6 input fields.
            - 2 names
            - 2 passwords
            - 1 email
            - 1 phone number
            - Focused elements should be blue with box shadow.
            - Invalid fields should have a red background.
            - Javascript should be used to validate the password fields.
        - Submit button
        - Already log in field
    - Try to keep a theme.
